## Project Description

This project evaluates a nutritional supplement's effectiveness in improving sleep quality for adults with self-reported sleep difficulties. It involves a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 50 participants aged (18-60). Participants are assigned to either the supplement or placebo group without knowledge of their assignment, allowing unbiased evaluation of the supplement's impact on sleep quality.

### About the App
A data collection app was built with R-Shiny will be used to gather participant data on sleep quality. It will capture information like participant ID, demographics, and baseline characteristics. Sleep quality data will be collected through self-reported measures including sleep duration and daytime sleepiness.

Data entered is automatically saved and updated in a desktop Excel workbook, ensuring secure storage and easy access. The workbook acts as a centralized database, dynamically updating with each new entry from the app. Real-time updates enable efficient data tracking and management, facilitating ongoing analysis of the nutritional supplement's impact on sleep quality.

To run the data entry Shiny app, you have two options:

1. Click [here](https://fboatengs.shinyapps.io/database/) to access the app online.

2. Alternatively, you can copy the code and run it locally on your computer.
