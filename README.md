# Project Description
The goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a nutritional supplement in improving sleep quality among adults who experience sleep difficulties. The project involves conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a sample of 50 adults aged 18-60 who have self-reported sleep difficulties.

In this study, participants will be randomly assigned to two groups: the intervention group and the placebo group. The intervention group will receive the nutritional supplement, while the placebo group will receive a similar-looking placebo without any active ingredients. Both groups will be unaware of whether they are receiving the actual supplement or the placebo, ensuring a double-blind design where neither the participants nor the researchers know the group assignments.
